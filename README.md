This repository is a "Comet Busters! 1994"'s remake using SDL as a way to both study the SDL engine in C++ and recollect the very first offline multiplayer game that I played in my childhood 

## Execution

> Make sure that you have SDL2 installed in your computer

For UNIX platforms, is available a [Makefile](Makefile) to compile and execute the game with the command: 
```sh
make all
```
